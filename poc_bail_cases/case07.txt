The applicant apprehends his arrest by Police Station -

             Barud, District - Khargone in Crime No.146/2015 under

             sections 307, 120-B of IPC and 25, 27 of Arms Act.
      According to the prosecution story,      in the night of

02.09.2015 at about 2:00 am, complainant Kamal was

attacked by some unknown persons by firing over him

gunshot by 12 bore gun. The crime was registered. During

investigation, on source information, co-accused Dhekaliya

and Deva were arrested. From their possession, 12 bore gun

and some live cartridges were recovered. In their, discloser

memo prepared under section 27 of the Evidence Act, they

disclosed that they attacked on the complainant, as they were

paid Rs.50,000/- by the present applicant Shyam Patidar.

Thus, they were acting as hire assassin and attacked on the

complainant.

     Arguments heard. Case diary perused.

     Counsel for the State and complainant opposed the

application on the ground that it is a case under section 307

of IPC. Custodial interrogation is required against the present

applicant.
      Counsel for the applicant submits that apart from the

discloser memo given by the co-accused under section 27 of

the Evidence Act, no other evidence is available against the

present applicant. Also, the complainant in this case filed an

affidavit in support of present applicant stating therein that

present applicant is suffering from mental ailment. He has no

dispute with the present applicant.

     While dismissing the application, the 4th Additional

Sessions Judge observed that this affidavit cannot be taken in

to consideration at this stage.

     In the considered opinion of this Court, this affidavit

cannot be taken into consideration at this stage. However,

looking to the evidence available against the present

applicant and also taking into consideration that he is

suffering from mental ailment, this application is allowed.

     It is directed that in the event of arrest, the applicant

shall be released on anticipatory bail on his furnishing a
             personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand only) and

            a solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the

            concerning Magistrate or Arresting Officer as the case may

            be, with the following conditions:-

            (i) that he shall make himself available for interrogation by a

            police officer as and when required.

            (ii) that he shall not, directly or indirectly, make any

            inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with

            the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing

            such facts to the Court or to any police officer.

            (iii) that he would comply with the conditions enumerated

            under section 437(3) Cr.P.C. meticulously.

                 Certified copy as per rules.

                     Shri Anand Soni, learned counsel for the applicant.

                     Shri   Mukesh    Parwal,   learned   counsel   for    the

             respondent/State.

                     This is first application under section 438 of Cr.P.C.

             filed on behalf of present applicant for grant of anticipatory

             bail.

                     The applicant apprehends his arrest by Police Station -

             Depalpur, District - Indore in Crime No.330/2015 under

             section 34(2) of MP Excise Act.

                     According to the prosecution story, on source

             information, motorcycle bearing registration No.MP-10-BA-

             2598 was intercepted by the police. The motorcycle was

             being driven by Sabir Kha and in the gunny bags loaded on
 the motorcycle, total 54 bulk liters of contraband country

liquor was found in his possession.

     During investigation, on his discloser memo prepared

under section 27 of the Evidence Act, he informed the police

that he brought the contraband country liquor from the

present applicant. However, no legal evidence is available

against him at present.

     Arguments heard. Case diary perused.

     Counsel for the State opposes the application on the

ground that his custody shall be required, as it has to be

asserted from where he obtains the contraband country liquor

and supplies to various persons.

     Counsel for the applicant submits that in the similar

case arising from the similar Police Station - Depalpur, he

was granted anticipatory bail by the Co-ordinate Bench of

this Court in MCRC No.8771/2015 vide order dated

05.10.2015.
                      However, in the considered opinion of this Court, the

                order of granting bail is based on the facts which do not have

                value of precedence and, therefore, present case has to be

                evaluated on merit. So far as the present case is concerned, it

                is true that his custodial interrogation may be required for

                asserting the source of the contraband country liquor.

                     As such, I find that no case is made out for grant of

                anticipatory bail to the present applicant.

                     The application is accordingly, dismissed.

                     Certified copy as per rules.

        This is first bail application under section 439 Cr.P.C
filed on behalf of the present applicants for grant of bail.
        The present applicants were arrested by Police Station-

offence punishable under sections 326, 325, 147, 149, 294,
341, 323 and 506-B of IPC.
        According to the prosecution story, the incident took
place on 08.06.2015 at about 8:00 pm. It is alleged that
present applicants alongwith other two co-accused Bhiyaram
and Bhairam armed with lathi, hockey stick and iron rod etc
inflicted grievous injuries on Kailash, Tikhla and Mahendra. It
is further alleged that accused Prakash inflicted injuries on
the right leg of Kailash by iron rod due to which, he suffered
fracture of femur bone.
        Counsel for the applicants objects and submits that
objection cannot be filed on behalf of eye witness, who is
neither complainant nor he suffered injuries in the present
case.
        The objection is accepted. Counsel for the objector is
 disallowed to participate in the proceedings.

application.

accused Prakash, all other persons were not armed with
lethal weapons. The injured has been admitted in the hospital

their furnishing a personal bond of Rs.30,000/- (Rs. Thirty
Thousand) each and one solvent surety each of the like

                   This is first bail application under section 439 Cr.P.C
              filed on behalf of the present applicant for grant of bail.
                   The present applicant was arrested by Police Station-
              Shahar Kotwali, District - Mandsaur in Crime No.512/15 for
              the offence punishable under section 34(2) of MP Excise Act
              for keeping in his possession 81 bulk liters of contraband
              country liquor.
                   Arguments heard. Case-diary perused.
                   Learned counsel for the State opposed the bail
             application.
                  Learned counsel for the applicant submits that there is
            no criminal antecedents of the present applicant. He is falsely
            implicated in the present case.
                  After     perusing   the   case-diary   and   taking   into
            consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case,
            without commenting on the merits of the case, I am of the
            view that it is a fit case for grant of bail. The application is
            allowed.
                  It is directed that applicant shall be released on bail on
            his furnishing a personal bond of Rs.30,000/- (Rs. Thirty
            Thousand) and one solvent surety of the like amount to the
            satisfaction of the concerned Magistrate for his appearance
            on all the dates of hearing as may be directed in this regard
            during trial.
                  The applicant is further directed that on being so
            released on bail, he would comply with the conditions
            enumerated under section 437 (3) Cr.P.C meticulously.
                  C.c. as per rules.

                   Shri Vikas Jain, learned counsel for the applicant.
                   Shri    Romesh      Dave,    learned     counsel      for   the
             respondent/State.
                   This application under section 482 of Cr.P.C. is filed against
             the order passed by learned Special Judge under NDPS Act,
             District - Neemuch in Special Sessions Trial No.01/2014 dated
             14.07.2015.
                   The brief facts relevant for disposal of this case are that the
             applicant filed an application before this Court under section 482
             of Cr.P.C. in which the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court by order
             dated 03.11.2014 issued following directions:-
                                 Present petitioner is permitted to
                           withdraw the petition with a direction to the
                           trial Court to consider the averments and
                           points raised in the petition at the time of
                           framing of charge alongwith the averments
                           of charge-sheet.

                   Learned Special Judge passed the impugned order on
             04.12.2014 apparently one month after the order passed by this
             Court by which, learned Magistrate framed charges against the
             present applicant, however, as directed by this Court, the
             averments and points raised in the petition were not taken into
             consideration. Thereafter, the applicant again filed an application
 before learned Special Judge which was disposed of by order
dated 11.12.2014 stating therein that a criminal court had no
jurisdiction to review on its own order and, therefore, giving
liberty that the order may be challenged in the revision, the
application was dismissed.
      Aggrieved by this order, the applicant again approached this
Court in the second round of litigation under section 482 of Cr.P.C.
which was disposed of by this Court in MCRC No.54/2015 vide
order dated 25.06.2015. In this order, following directions were
issued:-
                 In view of this observation and in the
           light of the direction issued by this Court
           earlier, this application is allowed. The
           impugned order dated 04.12.2014 is set
           aside. The matter is remanded back to the
           concerning Court with the direction that
           learned Special Judge should reconsider the
           matter and decide it in the light of the
           direction issued by this Court earlier in
           MCRC No.7577/2014.

      After passing of this order, learned Special Judge passed the
impugned order on 14.07.2015 in which, he again opined that the
point raised by the respondent cannot be taken into consideration
at the stage of filing of charge-sheet and without taking them into
consideration, the impugned order was passed.
      It is apparent that learned Special Judge has not taken into
             consideration the averments and points raised by the applicant
            and without taking into consideration the direction of this Court,
            the order was passed and, therefore, it appears proper to set aside
            the impugned order and remand the matter back to the Special
            Court for reconsideration and pass suitable order as per the
            direction issued by this Court.
                  Accordingly, this application is allowed. The impugned
            order is set aside. Learned Special Judge is directed to consider
            the averments and points raised by the present applicant and
            pass a suitable and detailed order this time.
                  In case, direction issued by this Court is not followed by the
            Special Judge, the matter may be taken as contempt of Court and
            necessary proceedings shall be initiated.
                  With the direction and observation as aforesaid, the
            application stands disposed of.
                  Let copy of this order be placed before the Hon'ble portfolio
            Judge and also be sent to the Sessions Judge, Neemuch, for
            consideration while writing Confidential Report of the concerning
            officer.
                  C.c. as per rules.

                   Shri Mahendra Kumar Sharma, learned counsel for the
             applicants.
                   Shri    Mukesh    Parwal,   learned    counsel   for   the
             respondent/State.
                   Case diary is available.
                   This is first bail application under section 439 Cr.P.C for
             grant of bail.
                   The present applicant was arrested by Police Station-
             Dewas Gate, District - Ujjain in Crime No.30/2015 for the
             offence punishable under sections 364, 365, 302 and 201/34
             of IPC and under section 3 (2) (5) of SC/ST (Prevention of
             Atrocities) Act.
                   According to the prosecution story, in the intervening
             night of 18th and 19th February, 2015 at about 01:00 am,
             present applicant alongwith other co-accused committed
             murder of deceased Sanjay @ Sanju Jhanjhot. Subsequently,
             they threw the dead body of the deceased under the culvert
             of Kalisindh river and also discharged mobile phone and
             other items of the deceased after pouring petrol on it.
                   So far as the present applicant is concerned, it is alleged
 that he was also with the co-accused persons during
commission of crime.
     Arguments heard. Case-diary perused.
     Learned counsel for the State opposed the bail
application.
     Learned counsel for the applicants submits that initially,
his name was not included in the accused persons, however,
on memorandum of co-accused, present applicant was
arrested and then, on 10.05.2015, statement of Manish Rai
was recorded in which, he stated that he saw present
applicant also with the other co-accused, while they were
committing the murder. He further submits that no
justification was given why statement of this witness was not
recorded on 10.05.2015. He further submits that similarly,
statement of Anil Thakur was recorded on 13.03.2015 and in
his statement also, no explanation was given why his
statement was not recorded immediately after the incident.
     I have gone through the case diary.
     There are two witnesses, who confirmed presence of
the present applicant with the co-accused persons. Merely
because, there statements were recorded with some delay, at
this stage, no benefit can be given to the present applicant.
               This apart, blood stained clothes were also recovered on his
              discloser memo. In the considered opinion of this Court, no
              case is made out for grant of bail to the present applicant.
                    The application is accordingly, dismissed.
                    C.c. as per rules.

                                                                   Judge

                    Shri    Mukesh       Sinjonia,    learned   counsel   for   the
              applicants.
                    Shri    Romesh        Dave,      learned    counsel   for   the
              respondent/State.
                    Shri Navneet Kishore Verma, learned counsel for the
              objector.
                    Case diary is available.
                    This is third bail application under section 439 Cr.P.C
              for grant of bail.
                    Their first application was dismissed, as withdrawn in
              MCRC No.6100/2015 vide order dated 23.07.2015 after
              arguing the matter for some time. Their second application
 was dismissed in MCRC No.6145/2015 vide order dated
21.08.2015. Their second application was dismissed, as it was
filed only after five days of withdrawing the first application,
which was not found proper and liberty was granted to the
present applicants to file afresh application to be considered
on merit after filing of the charge-sheet. Accordingly, this
third application is filed availing the liberty granted by this
Court to the applicant after filing of the charge-sheet.
     Counsel for the Objector raised preliminary objection
that once the application is dismissed, second application is
not maintainable, unless there should be a substantial change
in the circumstances and not cosmetic change. For this, he
cites judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of
State of Maharashtra Vs. Captain Buddhikota Subha Rao
reported in SCC-1989-SUPP2-605. But the principle laid
down in the aforesaid case is not applicable in the present
case. In that case, three consecutive applications were
dismissed on merit and, therefore, Hon'ble the Supreme
Court laid down the above principle.
     However, in this case, earlier two applications were not
considered on merit and also, while dismissing the second
application, liberty was granted to the applicants to file
 afresh application after charge-sheet is filed. In this view of
the matter, I find that this third application is maintainable.
     The present applicants were arrested by Police Station-
Kalapipal, District - Shajapur in Crime No.250/15 for the
offence punishable under sections 307, 147, 148, 149, 294,
323 and 325 of IPC.
     According to the prosecution story, the incident took
place on 26.06.2015 at about 11:00 pm. The dispute arose on
the way between two fields. The co-accused Mansingh
challenged complainant to come on his land and they were
waiting for him. Thereafter, accused persons went and
started started using abusive language against him. When
Leeladhar came to intervene, he was given blow by Farsi on
his head.
     Arguments heard. Case-diary perused.
     Learned counsel for the State opposed the bail
application.
     Learned counsel for the applicants submits that there is
a counter case also registered. He further submits that
charge-sheet has been filed and present applicants are not
required for investigation.
     Counsel for the objector, however, submits that two
             persons suffered more than ten injuries in this case and there
            is a dispute between two sections of same village and if bail is
            granted to the present applicants, the dispute may again take
            place.
                 After   perusing     the   case-diary   and   taking   into
            consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case,
            without commenting on the merits of the case, I am of the
            view that it is a fit case for grant of bail. The application is
            allowed.
                 It is directed that applicants shall be released on bail on
            their furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty
            Thousand) each and one solvent surety each of the like
            amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Magistrate for
            their appearance on all the dates of hearing as may be
            directed in this regard during trial.
                 The applicants are further directed that on being so
            released on bail, they would comply with the conditions
            enumerated under section 437 (3) Cr.P.C meticulously.
                 C.c. as per rules.

                      This is third application under section 439 of Cr.P.C.

                       The main ground taken by counsel for the applicant is that

                present applicant is under custody for the last one year and still,

                there is no progress in trial, as other co-accused are not arrested

                so far. He further submits that other co-accused granted bail under

                section 167(2) of Cr.P.C. and the present applicant remains in

                custody though, he is not the main accused in the case.

                      Let a report be called from the Sessions Judge, Indore. He

                may be requested to go through the record of the case and submit

                his report alongwith the reasons for delay in the present case. He

                may further be requested to submit his comments as to time frame

        This is first application under section 438 of Cr.P.C.

filed on behalf of present applicant for grant of anticipatory

bail.

        The applicants apprehend their arrest by Police Station

- Chhapiheda, Tehsil - Biaora, District - Rajgarh in Crime

No.172/2014 under sections 294, 323, 506/34 and 436 of

IPC.

        According to the prosecution story, present applicants

were earlier arrested in the same crime number under

sections 294, 323 and 506/34 of IPC. They were granted bail

by the Magistrate. However, subsequently, section 436 of

IPC was added and now, present applicants apprehend their

arrest as trial under section 436 is sessions trial and the

Magistrate does not have power to grant bail under this

section.
      Arguments heard. Case diary perused.

     Counsel for the State opposes the application.

     Taking all the facts and circumstances of the case into

consideration, without commenting on the merits of the case,

I find that it is fit case where the benefit of provision under

section 438 of Cr.P.C. may be extended to the present

applicants. Accordingly, the application is allowed.

     It is directed that in the event of arrest, the applicants

shall be released on anticipatory bail on their furnishing a

by a police officer as and when required.

                      Case diary is available.

                      This is third bail application under section 439 Cr.P.C

                for grant of bail.
      His first application was dismissed on merit in MCRC

No.128/2015 vide order dated 13.03.2015 on medical ground

and also on the ground that daughter of the present applicant

died recently. His second application for grant of temporary

bail was dismissed in MCRC No.3516/2015 vide order dated

25.06.2015. In the second application, it was directed that if

the present applicant wishes to get himself operated in a

private hospital and if he deposits necessary amount with the

jail authorities as per the estimate given by the concerning

hospital, he may be admitted in the hospital under the

security and necessary operation may be performed on him.

     Now, this third application is filed on the ground that

when the hospital authorities, where the present applicant

wants to get himself operated, were contacted by the family

members of the present applicant, they informed that they

could not give any estimate unless the patient is examined.

Therefore, counsel for the applicant prays that present
             applicant be released on temporary bail for fifteen days so

            that he may get himself examined and necessary estimate be

            prepared.

                 Counsel for the CBN submits that for the examination,

            he may be taken to the hospital under security and after

            examination, necessary estimate can be prepared.

                 After taking into consideration rival contentions

            putforth by both the counsels, it is directed that the present

            applicant be taken to a private hospital, where he wants to get

            himself operated under proper security and after his

            examination by the doctors, he be re-lodged in jail. It is

            further directed that after estimate is prepared, directions

            issued in the earlier order would operate.

                 C.c. as per rules.

                   This is second bail application under section 439 Cr.P.C for

             grant of temporary bail.

                   This second application is filed on the ground that son of

             the present applicant is suffering from rare disease known as

             "Krabbe disease". It is advised by the doctor that child should be

             taken to Mumbai or Delhi and should be treated by the specialist

             doctors, who are not available at Indore. Counsel for the

             applicant has filed medical papers of the child with the

             application, which were duly verified. As per the report, the child

             is suffering from serious disease of brain and he is advised by the

             doctors to be taken to Mumbai for further treatment.

                   I have heard counsel for the parties.
                      After taking into consideration all the facts and

               circumstances of the case and the medical condition of the child

               of present applicant, the application for grant of temporary bail is

               allowed.

                     It is directed that applicant shall be released on temporary

               bail for the period of thirty days from the date of his release on

               his furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty

               Thousand) and one solvent surety of the like amount to the

               satisfaction of the trial Judge. The trial Judge is directed to fix a

               date for his surrender before the Court depending upon his

               release from jail.

       Shri Sanjay Sharma, learned counsel for the applicant.

      Shri       Mukesh   Parwal,   learned   counsel   for    the

respondent/State.

      Case diary is available.

      This is first bail application under section 439 Cr.P.C for

grant of bail.

      The present applicant was arrested by Police Station- City

Kotwali, District - Mandsaur in Crime No.502/15 for the offence

punishable under sections 323, 344, 365, 347, 384, 386 and 506

of IPC.

      According to the prosecution story, on 26.07.2015 abductee

Tarachand Gandhi went to a Tea Stall for having tea. There, it is

alleged that present applicant alongwith co-accused Mahesh and

his maternal uncle came in Bolero vehicle and they forcibly took

abductee Tarachand Gandhi to village Khanderiyamaru and kept

him there tied. By threatening him, they pressurized him to

execute power of attorney for transfer of his revenue land and a

house. For making his voter I.D. Card, they took him to
 Mandsaur Court and there, they completed formalities for making

of Voter I.D. Card. They also got sale deed executed in favour of

Maya W/o Mukesh Pawar. It is further alleged that prior to the

incident also, they took Rs.40,000/- from abductee Tarachand

Gandhi on the promise that they would sale him Nano Car but the

Car was not given to him.

     Arguments heard. Case-diary perused.

     Learned counsel for the State opposed the bail application

on the ground that present applicant took law into his hand and

then forcibly got the sale deed of the land executed in favour of

Maya W/o Mukesh Pawar.

     Learned counsel for the applicant submits that it was a civil

dispute. Present applicant and said Tarachand Gandhi had some

financial dealings with each other and some money was due with

Tarachand Gandhi. Due to this reason, he was falsely implicated

in the case. According to him, he voluntarily executed the sale

deed in favour of Maya W/o Mukesh Pawar.

     After perusing the case-diary and taking into consideration
                all the facts and circumstances of the case, without commenting

               on the merits of the case, I am of the view that it is a fit case for

               grant of bail. The application is allowed.

                     It is directed that applicant shall be released on bail on his

               furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand)

               and one solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of

               the concerned Magistrate for his appearance on all the dates of

               hearing as may be directed in this regard during trial.

                     The applicant is further directed that on being so released

               on bail, he would comply with the conditions enumerated under

                        Smt. Mamta Shandilya, learned counsel for the

                respondent/State.

                        This is first application under section 438 of Cr.P.C.

                filed on behalf of present applicant for grant of anticipatory

                bail.
      The applicant apprehend his arrest by Police Station -

Kukshi, District - Dhar under sections 366, 506 and 376 of IPC.

     According to the prosecution story, the incident took

place on 01.09.2014 when the prosecutrix and her brother was

going in a Magic Vehicle, about 22 persons came there in

another vehicle and it is alleged that they forcibly took the

prosecutrix with them and co-accused Raju Chouhan, who was

handicapped and to whom, the prosecutrix got married under

Arya Samaj customs, committed rape on her.

     So far as the present applicant is concerned, it is alleged

that co-accused Raju Chouhan and the prosecutrix stayed in the

house of the present applicant for some time.

     Arguments heard. Case diary perused.

      Counsel for the State opposes the application.

     Counsel for the applicant submits that co-accused Raju

Chouhan has already granted bail by the Court below. He

further submits tha present applicant is a government servant

and the only allegation against him is that co-accused Raju
 Chouhan and the prosecutrix stayed in his house for some

time.

        Taking all the facts and circumstances of the case into

consideration, without commenting on the merits of the case,

I find that it is fit case where the benefit of provision under

section 438 of Cr.P.C. may be extended to the present

applicants. Accordingly, the application is allowed.

        It is directed that in the event of arrest, the applicant

shall be released on anticipatory bail on his furnishing a

personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand only) and

a solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the

concerning Magistrate or Arresting Officer as the case may

be, with the following conditions:-

(i) that he shall make himself available for interrogation by a

police officer as and when required.

(ii) that he shall not, directly or indirectly, make any

inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with

the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing
                 such facts to the Court or to any police officer.

                (iii) that he would comply with the conditions enumerated

                under section 437(3) Cr.P.C. meticulously.

      Shri   Mukesh    Parwal,   learned    counsel   for   the

respondent/State.

      Shri Ali Hussain, learned counsel for the objector.

      Case diary is available.

      This is first bail application under section 439 Cr.P.C

for grant of bail.

      The present applicants were arrested by Police Station-

Nalkheda, District - Agar in Crime No.185/15 for the offence

punishable under sections 307, 147, 148, 149 & 506 IPC.

      According to the prosecution story, the incident took

place on 14.07.2015. The dispute arose due to passing

through the fields of complainant and then it is alleged that

present applicants have inflicted injury to Shahrukh Khan,

Rajjak Khan and Babu Khan by lathi. Babu Khan sustained

injury on his head with corresponding fracture of skull bone.

      Arguments heard. Case-diary perused.
      Learned counsel for the State and Objector opposed the

bail application. Learned counsel for the Objector submits

that on being released from jail, accused persons will

threaten them. They used abusive language against them.

They further said that as soon as their brothers come out of

the jail, they will drive them away from the village. They

apprehend that they are going to commit serious offence

against them.

     Learned counsel for the applicants submits that charge

sheet has been filed in this case and injured has been

discharged from hospital. Present applicants are not required

by the Police for investigation. He further submits that a

cross case is also registered at Crime No.186/15 against the

complainant party. He further submits that co-accused

persons granted bail in MCRC Nos.7951/2015 and

8253/2015 vide order dated 09.09.2015 and 28.09.2015

respectively. The case of the present applicants is not
 different than that of co-accused, who were granted bail,

therefore, on the principle of parity, he prays that bail should

be granted to the present applicants. He further submits that

apprehension of the objector is baseless. No case was

registered by the police and only to keep the applicants in

jail, a false complaint was lodged by the complainant.

     After    perusing    the   case-diary   and   taking   into

consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case,

without commenting on the merits of the case, I am of the

view that it is a fit case for grant of bail. The application is

allowed.

     It is directed that applicants shall be released on bail on

their furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty

Thousand) each and one solvent surety each of the like

amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Magistrate for

their appearance on all the dates of hearing as may be

directed in this regard during trial.
                       The applicants are further directed that on being so

                released on bail, they would comply with the conditions

                enumerated under section 437 (3) Cr.P.C meticulously.

07.10.2015
      Shri Sudeep Bhargav, learned counsel for the

respondent.

     This is an enquiry under section 340 of Cr.P.C. The

facts which necessitated this enquiry are that Professor

Chintaman     Malviya    (hereinafter   referred   to   as   the

'respondent') is returned candidate from Lok Sabha

Constituency No.2, Ujjain (M.P.) in general election of Lok

Sabha held in the month of March-April, 2014. An Election

Petition was filed against the respondent challenging his

election to Lok Sabha which was registered as Election

Petition No.33/2014. In this petition, notice was issued to the

respondent bearing No.1762 dated 12.08.2014. Notice was

sent to the District Judge, Ujjain, for service upon the

respondent. The notice was served by process server Shri

Arun Bhalerao on 16.08.2014 personally on the respondent.

2.   However, respondent remained absent before the

Election Judge and, therefore, Election Petition filed against
 him proceeded ex-parte. Subsequent to this, he filed an

application under Order 9 Rule 7 of CPC for setting aside the

ex-parte order passed against him. In support of the

application, he filed an affidavit stating therein that the notice

was served on his staff while he was busy in the ongoing

session of the Parliament. When he came back to Ujjain, he

came to know about the notice when it was placed before

him and thereafter, immediately, he proceeded to take

necessary action for setting aside of the ex-parte order. When

this application is filed by respondent, the applicant filed I.A.

No.1303/2015 under section 340 of Cr.P.C. stating therein

that respondent made false statement in the affidavit and

thereby he committed offence under section 193 of IPC and

he further prayed that suitable action be taken against the

respondent.

3.   The Co-ordinate Bench of this Court to which the

Election Petition was assigned, passed an order dated
 24.03.2015 on the application. In para 8 and 9 of the order,

the Co-ordinate Bench observed as under:-
           (8) So far as the application of petitioner is
           concerned, prima facie it seems that the
           respondent No.1 himself has received the notice
           of this petition on 16.08.2014 whereas, on oath
           he stated that he received the notice of this
           petition on 25.01.2015 through his employee.
           This controversy can be resolved only after the
           enquiry, therefore, the Principal Registrar of this
           Bench is directed to register a Misc. Criminal
           Case under section 340 of the Cr.P.C. against the
           respondent No.1and initiate the enquiry and after
           making due enquiry if he finds that respondent
           NO.1 has filed a false affidavit in support of I.A.
           No.927/2015 then file a private complaint against
           respondent No.1 before the competent
           Magistrate. Thus, the application (I.A.
           No.1303/2015) is allowed.
           (9) Reader is directed to send the photocopy of
           this order alongwith the original second copy of
           notice of respondent No.1 and service report of
           process server in a sealed envelope for
           compliance of the order to Principal Registrar of
           this Bench. Whereas, the photocopy of the notice
           and service report of process server be kept with
           this record.
4.   The enquiry was assigned to the Principal Registrar of
 this Bench of High Court. However, it was pointed out by the

registry that under section 340 of Cr.P.C., enquiry should

have been conducted by the Court itself and, therefore, by

order dated 30.06.2015, this Court modified earlier order

passed by the Co-ordinate Bench and directed the registry to

place the matter before the Court for conducting enquiry.

5.   During the enquiry, statements of process server Arun

Bhalerao was recorded on 09.09.2015. He confirmed that he

served notice bearing No.1762 dated 12.08.2014 on the

respondent personally and also respondent signed it before

him. He was also cross examined by counsel for the

respondent. In his statement, he also stated that on that day,

another process server of Ujjain District Court, Bharat Singh

Chouhan was also on beat on that particular day and he was

with him when notice was served. He witnessed that notice

was served personally on the respondent. Subsequently,

statement of Bharat Singh Chouhan was also recorded and he
 confirmed in his statement that notice was served personally

on the respondent.

6.   After recording the statements and taking into

consideration the served notice bearing No.1762 dated

12.08.2014 and enclosed hukmnama, it is apparent that

notice was served personally on the respondent while in the

affidavit, he mentioned that notice was served on his staff.

7.   Counsel for the respondent cited judgment of Hon'ble

the Supreme Court in the case of Chhaju Ram Vs. Radhey

Shyam reported in 1971 Law Suit (SC) 204. In para 7 of the

Judgment, Hon'ble the Supreme Court observed here as

under:-
           (6)--------------------------------------------------------
           (7) The prosecution for perjury should be
           sanctioned by courts only in those cases where
           the perjury appears to be deliberate and
           conscious and the conviction is reasonably
           probable or likely. No doubt giving of false
           evidence and filing false affidavit is an evil
           which must be effectively curbed with a strong
           hand but to start prosecution for perjury too
            readily and too frequently with,out due care and
           caution and on inconclusive and doubtful
           material defeats its very purpose. Prosecution
           should be ordered when it is considered
           expedient in the interests of justice to punish the
           delinquent and not merely because there is some
           inaccuracy in the statement which may be
           innocent or immaterial. There must be prima
           facie case of deliberate falsehood on a matter of
           substance and the court should be satisfied that
           there is reasonable foundation for the charge.
           -----------------------------------------------------------
8. It is to be seen whether, it is in the interest of justice to punish the respondent whether, such lapses on his part are immaterial and innocent.

9. Counsel for the respondent argues that it was unintentional mistake on the part of the respondent and, therefore, no action should be taken against him.

10. In my considered opinion, however, more cautious and responsible approach was expected from the respondent being representative of people and professor himself. He is expected to understand the consequences of not appearing before the Court of law and specially before the High Court. Therefore, in this case, lenient and sympathetic view is not called for. In this view of the matter, I find that prosecution for perjury should be initiated against the respondent.

11. The Principal Registrar of this Court is authorised under section 195 (1)(b)(i) to file complaint in the concerning court of Magistrate. The Principal Registrar is directed to draft the complaint and place it before the Court for approval.

06.10.2015 Shri Sanjay Sharma, counsel for the applicant. Shri Mukesh Parwal, counsel for the respondent/State.

Case diary is available.

This is second bail application filed by the applicant under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for grant of bail.

The accused/applicant was arrested by the Police Station - Industrial Area, Jaora, District - Ratlam in Crime No.153/2015 under sections 307, 394, 341 and 506 of IPC.

According to the prosecution, present applicant alongwith other co-accused committed loot on the complainant Brajmohan and Babu. They also fired gunshot due to which, the complainant sustained some injuries. The present applicant alongwith the other co-accused, it is alleged, fled away from the spot. The matter was reported to the police station - Industrial Area, Jaora, District - Ratlam on which Crime No.152/2015 was registered. Thereafter, the Station Incharge of police station alongwith Constable Deepak Bhuria accompanied by complainant Brajmohan, Babu and Mohammad Anwar went out in search of the miscreants. They were told that three motorcycles went towards village Barkhedi and when they were going towards village Barkhedi, they saw four persons on three motorcycles. Present applicant was also there. When they were challenged by the police party, they opened gun fire on them. Nobody from the police party sustained any injury, however, in return, the police party also opened fire on them due to which, present applicant sustained injuries on his both thighs. Subsequently, present applicant and another co-accused Sunil were arrested.

This second application is filed on the ground that nd

(i) co-accused Sunil was granted bail by 2 Additional Sessions Judge on the ground that in the earlier part of prosecution story, in which present applicant allegedly committed loot on the complainant, co-accused Sunil was not identified by the complainant. (ii) There were four accused persons according to the prosecution story. However, during investigation, two accused persons fled away. The police did not take any action to trace the persons, who fled away from the spot and (iii) The prosecution witnesses Ghanshyam @ Kalu, Babulal and Mohd. Anwar gave affidavits in which they denied that any incident took place with them.

In this case, the incident took place in two parts. In the first part, loot was committed on the complainant and his companion Babu. In the second part, when the matter was reported to the police, the police tried to chase accused persons and then, it is said that present applicant fired gunshot which did not hit any of the police man but when the police fired in reply, present applicant sustained gunshot injuries. Two separate First Information Reports were prepared for Crime Nos.152/2015 and 153/2015.

Counsel for the applicant submits that as case of the co- accused Sunil is similar to the present applicant, present applicant should also be granted bail.

nd I have gone through the orders passed by learned 2 Additional Sessions Judge.

It is unfortunate that learned Additional Sessions Judge did not consider whether, case of the co-accused was similar to present applicant while bail application of the present applicant was dismissed by this Court on merits. There was no occasion for learned Additional Sessions Judge to grant bail to the co-accused, who was similarly placed. This apart, taking the affidavits filed by certain prosecution witnesses into consideration, is also not called for at this stage.

On merits, it is admitted that present applicant suffered gunshot injuries during the incident which shows his presence on the spot. The other co-accused, who was granted bail by learned Additional Sessions Judge, was named in the FIR and was identified by witnesses. The police, who went in search of the culprits, was an eye witness and even if some prosecution witnesses turned hostile, statements of the police in this case, cannot be disbelieved merely because they are police personnels. When the police personnels are eye witnesses, their statements must be examined like that of interested witnesses. But they are competent witnesses and their statements cannot be rejected on the face of it.

In this view of the matter, I find no change in the circumstances. This second application is not tenable, liable to be dismissed and is hereby, dismissed.

Let a copy of this order be sent to the Registrar cum P.P.S. to Hon'ble the Chief Justice with a request to place the same before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for necessary directions and suitable action.

Certified copy as per rules.

06.10.2015 Shri Nilesh Dave, learned counsel for the applicant. Shri Mukesh Parwal, learned counsel for the respondent /State.

06.10.2015 Shri AK Saraswat, learned counsel for the applicant. Shri Mukesh Parwal, learned counsel for the respondent /State.

Case diary is available.

This is 1st application filed by the applicant under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for grant of bail.

The accused/applicant was arrested by the Police Station - Raoji Bazar, District - Indore in Crime No.249/2015 under section 34 of MP Excise Act for keeping in her possession 57.6 bulk liters of contraband country liquor.

Learned counsel for the State opposes the bail application on the ground that as per the report received from the concerning police station, present applicant is a habitual offender and dealing with in contraband country liquor though, there is no crime registered against her apart from the present case.

Arguments heard, case diary perused. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that present applicant is a lady and falsely implicated in the case.

Taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, without commenting on the merits of the case, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail. The application filed under section 439 of the Cr.P.C. is allowed on the condition that after being released on bail, she will not indulge in any kind of criminal activities whatsoever. It is directed that the applicant shall be released on bail subject to the aforesaid condition and on her furnishing a personal bond of Rs.30,000/- (Rs.

Case diary is available.

This is first bail application under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for grant of bail filed by the applicant.

The accused/applicant was arrested by the Police Station - Ingoriya, District - Ujjain in Crime No.312/2015 under sections 341, 294, 323, 506/34 and 376 (D)/34 of IPC.

According to the prosecution story, the incident took place on 21.06.2015 when the prosecutrix went to attend call of nature at about 08.30 in the night. It is alleged that present applicant alongwith two other co-accused caught hold of her and committed gang rape on her. Thereafter, they also threatened her that if she disclose the incident to anybody, they would kill her.

When the matter was reported on 21.06.2015, there was no mention of committing rape with her in the FIR. In her statement recorded on 22.06.2015 also, there was no such allegation of rape. However, her statement was again recorded on 24.06.2015 then, she added the incident of rape. She was medically examined in which some bruises on both her thighs and no other injury was found. In her statement made under section 164 of Cr.P.C. also which was recorded on 24.06.2015, she narrated the whole incident, as she narrated under section 161 of Cr.P.C.

Learned counsel for the State opposes the application. Arguments heard, case diary perused. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that only one accused Govind was named in the FIR. However, in her statements made under section 164 of Cr.P.C., she stated that she knew all the accused persons.

Taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, without commenting on the merits of the case, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail. The application filed under section 439 of the Cr.P.C. is allowed.

It is directed that the applicant shall be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand only) and one solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned Magistrate for his appearance on all the dates of hearing as may be directed in this regard during trial.

He is further directed that on being so released on bail, he would comply with the conditions enumerated under section 437(3) Cr.P.C. meticulously.

Case diary is available.

This is first bail application under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for grant of bail filed by the applicant.

The accused/applicant was arrested by the Police Station - Lalghati, District - Shajapur in Crime No.02/2015 under sections 363, 366 and 376(2)(n) of IPC and under section 3/4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act.

According to the prosecution story, the prosecutrix, who was aged about 17 years and 7 months at the time of incident, went missing. Subsequently, she was recovered from possession of the present applicant. In her statement made under section 164 of Cr.P.C., she did not support case of the prosecution and stated that she was married to the present applicant and went with him with her own free will.

Learned counsel for the State opposes the application. Arguments heard, case diary perused. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that in the Ossification Test, age of the prosecutrix was assessed to be 18 to 19 years. He further submits that she was major at the time of the incident. She went with the present applicant with her own consent, therefore, no case is made out against the present applicant.

Taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, without commenting on the merits of the case, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail. The application filed under section 439 of the Cr.P.C. is allowed.

It is directed that the applicant shall be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs.

Shri Mukesh Parwal, learned counsel for the respondent/State.

This is second application under section 438 of Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of present applicants for grant of anticipatory bail. Their first application was dismissed, as withdrawn in MCRC No.4922/2015 vide order dated 22.06.2015. A liberty was granted to the present applicants to surrender before the trial Court and direction was given to the trial Court to decide the application of regular bail, as expeditiously as possible.

This second application is filed on the ground that there is subsequent change in the circumstances. The present applicants found in possession of Compact Disk in which brother of the deceased Dheeraj gave statement to the TV Channel that the deceased committed suicide when the police came in search of him, as complaint was lodged against him by one Pinky Sen. However, such statements given to a news channel or news published in the news paper do not form any change in the circumstances. Instead of availing the liberty granted by this Court, this second application is filed.

Accordingly, in the considered opinion of this Court, no case is made out for grant of anticipatory bail to the present applicants. The application is not maintainable, deserves to be dismissed and is hereby, dismissed.

05.10.2015 Shri Manish Vijayvargiya, learned counsel for the applicants.

Shri Mukesh Parwal, learned counsel for the respondent no.1/State.

This is first application under section 438 of Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of present applicants for grant of anticipatory bail.

The applicants apprehend their arrest in Criminal Complaint No.586/2015 pending before learned JMFC, Shujalpur under section 467, 468, 420 and 120-B of IPC.

As per the allegations made in the complaint, present applicants sold the land in joint ownership of the complainant and the present applicants and conspiring with the accused No.1- Ramesh. They also got the land mutated in their names.

Respondent No.2 was served notice of this application but he failed to appear before the Court.

Counsel for the applicants submits that initially learned JMFC refused to take cognizance on the ground that it is purely a civil matter, however the complainant filed revision of the order and on the direction of the revisional court, cognizance was taken. According to them, it is a case based on the documentary evidence. There is no chance of the present applicants' absconding, therefore, bail may be granted to the present applicants.

Arguments heard. Case diary perused. Counsel for the State opposes the application. Taking all the facts and circumstances of the case into consideration, without commenting on the merits of the case, I find that it is fit case where the benefit of provision under section 438 of Cr.P.C. may be extended to the present applicants. Accordingly, the application is allowed.

It is directed that in the event of arrest, the applicants shall be released on anticipatory bail on their furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand only) each and a solvent surety each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerning Magistrate or Arresting Officer as the case may be, with the following conditions:-

(i) that they shall make themselves available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required.
(ii) that they shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer.
(iii) that they would comply with the conditions enumerated under section 437(3) Cr.P.C. meticulously.

Shri Govind Purohit, learned counsel for the respondent/EOW.

This is first application under section 438 of Cr.P.C. filed on behalf of present applicants for grant of anticipatory bail.

The applicants apprehend their arrest by Police Station - Economic Offences Wing, District - Indore in Crime No.35/2012 under sections 420, 406, 409 and 120-B of IPC.

According to the prosecution story, present applicants were office bearers of the Co-operative Housing Society. They purchased some agricultural land in the year 1987. According to the prosecution, they purchased land by the Cooperative Society in contravention of Nagar Bhoomi (Seema Evam Viniyam) Adhiniyam, 1976. Subsequently, about 2 and half acre of the land was sold by the society and the society earned profit of Rs.7,00,000/-. According to the prosecution, profit earned by the society was not distributed by the office bearer to members of the society and they also did not alloted the land which remained in possession of the society.

According to the applicants, charge-sheet was filed under sections 420, 406 and 120-B of IPC, however, taking the present applicants are agents of the members of the society, the Magistrate took cognizance under section 409 of IPC.

Arguments heard. Case diary perused. Counsel for the State opposes the application. Counsel for the applicants submits that the matter began in the year 1987 when the land was purchased. There is no likelihood of the present applicants' absconding, as they are not habitual offenders and they are reputed persons of the society. The matter is based on the record and their presence is not required for investigation or for custodial interrogation.

Taking all the facts and circumstances of the case into consideration, without commenting on the merits of the case, I find that it is fit case where the benefit of provision under section 438 of Cr.P.C. may be extended to the present applicants. Accordingly, the application is allowed.

It is directed that in the event of arrest, the applicants shall be released on anticipatory bail on their furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- (Rs.

05.10.2015 Shri AK Saraswat, learned counsel for the applicant. Shri Mukesh Parwal, learned counsel for the respondent /State.

Case diary is available.

This is first bail application under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for grant of bail filed by the applicant.

The accused/applicant was arrested by the Police Station - Jawad, District - Neemuch in Crime No.488/2014 under sections 8/18 (B), 29 of NDPS Act.

According to the prosecution story, present applicant was travelling in car which belongs to co-accused, who was driving the car. From the gates of the car, inside the panels, there were secret chambers from which total 15 kg of the contraband Opium was recovered.

Counsel for the applicant submits that present applicant is a handicapped person. He has filed necessary documents to show that he is handicapped.

However, verification could not be done by counsel for the State. Still, he fairly admits that present applicant is handicapped person. However, counsel for the State submits that his defence that he only took lift in the car, from which the contraband was recovered, cannot be seen at this stage. He further submits that as per the source information received by the police, name of the present applicant was informed, therefore, he seriously opposed the bail application.

Counsel for the applicant submits that there is joint memo prepared under section 50 of the NDPS Act. He cites judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of State of Rajasthan Vs. Parmanand and another reported in 2014 Cr.L.R. (SC) 290 in which it was held that joint communication of the right under section 50 would result in diluting the right. Accused must always be individually informed.

However, at this stage, when we are considering bail, the effect of such joint memo cannot be seen. The main criteria can be seen whether the joint memo caused any prejudice to the defence of the present applicant, which can only be seen at the time of final hearing. At this stage, it cannot be said that merely because joint memo was prepared, the present applicant is entitled for bail.

So far as his defence is concerned that he took lift in the car without knowing that the contraband was being transported in the car and also that the contraband was in the door of the car, which was not in the knowledge of the present applicant, this fact can only be determined at the final stage after recording of the evidence. At this stage, no inference can be drawn. Looking to the quantity of the contraband, no case for grant of bail to the present applicant is made out.

The application is accordingly, dismissed. Certified copy as per rules.

On 01.06.2015, a message was received on the mobile phone asking for ransom of Rs.2,00,000/-, which she was using prior to going out from her home.

She is living with one Waseem to whom she is married now. He has filed affidavit of the prosecutrix and Waseem Taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case and also the role assigned to the present applicant, without commenting on the merits of the case, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail.
