He caught hold of her and took her to a room built at Tejlal Sahu's farm used for fastening bulls and committed rape with her there and also threatened to kill her. At about 12 a.m. the prosecutrix's father Ramdas and mother Sugarti Bai came there and on seeing them appellant fled away. Prosecutrix narrated the incident to them.They took her to P.S. Amla, Distt. Betul where she lodged the report. On that report, police registered Crime no.341/13 for the offences punishable under Sections 342, 376(2) (Jha) and 506 of I.P.C. and also under Sections 3 (2) (v) read with 3(1)(xii)of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 and investigated the matter. During investigation Police did not get the accused. So after investigation police filed the charge sheet in the absence of the appellant. On that, charge sheet, Special Case No. 31/17 was registered. Police arrested the appellant on 6/5/2017 and produced before the court. Learned Court sent him to judicial custody. On that appellant filed an application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. seeking bail, which was rejected by the learned Special Judge, SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act vide order dated 27/5/2017.

[5] Learned counsel for the State/Respondent No.1 opposed the prayer and submitted that In the marksheet the date of birth of prosecutrix is mentioned as 08/10/98 which shows that prosecutrix was only 15 years of age when the appellant committed rape with her and appellant remained absconded for a long period, So he shall not be released on bail. [6] Looking to the allegations levelled against the appellant that he committed rape of minor girl of 15 years and remained absconding for a long time after incident. Besides the possibility of tampering with the evidence by the accused if released on bail at this stage also can not be ruled out.So in the considered opinion of this court learned trial court did not commit any mistake in rejecting the application of applicant for releasing him on bail at this stage. So his appeal is rejected with the liberty that after recording the statement of the prosecutrix, the appellant is free to again file fresh bail application.

[2] As per prosecution case, on 26/9/2013 at about 8 p.m. when the prosecutrix was going to attend the call of nature near her house situated at village Jammwada, the appellant met her on the way. He caught hold of her and took her to a room built at Tejlal Sahu's farm used for fastening bulls and committed rape with her there and also threatened to kill her. At about 12 a.m. the prosecutrix's father Ramdas and mother Sugarti Bai came there and on seeing them appellant fled away. Prosecutrix narrated the incident to them.They took her to P.S. Amla, Distt. Betul where she lodged the report. On that report, police registered Crime no.341/13 for the offences punishable under Sections 342, 376(2) (Jha) and 506 of I.P.C. and also under Sections 3 (2) (v) read with 3(1)(xii)of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 and investigated the matter. During investigation Police did not get the accused. So after investigation police filed the charge sheet in the absence of the appellant. On that, charge sheet, Special Case No. 31/17 was registered. Police arrested the appellant on 6/5/2017 and produced before the court. Learned Court sent him to judicial custody. On that appellant filed an application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. seeking bail, which was rejected by the learned Special Judge, SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act vide order dated 27/5/2017. Being aggrieved by the impugned order, appellant filed this Criminal Appeal.

[3] Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that appellant has falsely been implicated in this matter. Appellant is in custody since 6/5/2017, the charge sheet has been filed and conclusion of trial will take time, so appellant be released on bail.

[4] Respondent No.2 and her counsel submitted that they have no objection on appellant being granted bail . [5] Learned counsel for the State/Respondent No.1 opposed the prayer and submitted that In the marksheet the date of birth of prosecutrix is mentioned as 08/10/98 which shows that prosecutrix was only 15 years of age when the appellant committed rape with her and appellant remained absconded for a long period, So he shall not be released on bail. [6] Looking to the allegations levelled against the appellant that he committed rape of minor girl of 15 years and remained absconding for a long time after incident. Besides the possibility of tampering with the evidence by the accused if released on bail at this stage also can not be ruled out.So in the considered opinion of this court learned trial court did not commit any mistake in rejecting the application of applicant for releasing him on bail at this stage. So his appeal is rejected with the liberty that after recording the statement of the prosecutrix, the appellant is free to again file fresh bail application.

Accordingly, Cr.A. No. 2239/2017 is disposed of. (RAJEEV KUMAR DUBEY) JUDGE m/-
