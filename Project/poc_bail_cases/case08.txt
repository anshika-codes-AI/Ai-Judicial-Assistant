1. The present appeal has been filed by the complainant- petitioner (hereinafter to be referred as 'complainant') against the order dated 04.05.2019 passed by learned Special Judge, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act & The Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, Dholpur in Case No.48/2019 whereby the accused-respondent No.2 (hereinafter to be referred as 'accused') was ordered to be released on bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the complainant submitted a missing report on 24.09.2016 of her minor daughter, aged about 16 years, on the basis of which FIR No.557/2016 was registered at Police Station Bari, District Dholpur for the offences under (2 of 7) [CRLAS-1135/2019] Sections 363, 366, 376D IPC and Section 5 & 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,2012 and Section 3-2(5), 3- 1(W-1) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (hereinafter to be referred as 'Act of 1989'). The police after investigation filed challan and arrested the accused namely Punjab Singh & other co-accused Aishveer. After arrest, the accused filed bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. before the learned trial Court which was dismissed by the learned trial court and being aggrieved the accused filed appeal before this Court under section 14-A(2) of the Act of 1989 bearing S.B. Criminal Appeal No.1597/2017 which was dismissed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 5-10-2017 which reads as under :-

"Learned counsel for the appellant submits that he may be permitted to withdraw the appeal to enable the appellant to file a fresh one after the statement of the prosecutrix is recorded during trial.
Ordered accordingly."
3. After recording statement of the prosecutrix during trial the accused thereafter filed appeal before this Court bearing S.B. Criminal Appeal No.598/2018 which was also dismissed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 16-5-2018 which reads as under :-

"Appellant has filed this appeal under Section 14-A(2) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,2016 in F.I.R. No.557/2016, registered at Police Station Badi, District Dholpur for the offence under Sections 363, 366, 376-D Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 5, 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and Section 3-1 (W-1), 3-2 (5) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,1989.
Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the appellant has been falsely involved in this case.
(3 of 7) [CRLAS-1135/2019] As per the prosecution story, appellant along with his co-accused had raped the prosecutrix aged about 16 years. Prosecutrix while appearing in the witness-box has duly supported the prosecution case.
In these circumstances, keeping in view the seriousness of allegations levelled against the appellant, no ground for grant of bail to him is made out.
Dismissed."
4. For third time again the appellant being aggrieved by the rejection of his bail application under section 439 Cr.P.C. by the learned trial court again filed appeal before this Court bearing S.B. Criminal Appeal No.1333/2018 which too was dismissed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 20-7-2018 which reads under :-

"Appellant has filed this appeal under Section 14-A(2) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,1989 seeking regular bail in F.I.R. No.557/2016 registered at Police Station Badi, District Dholpur for offences under Sections 363, 366, 376-D of Indian Penal Code, 1860, Section 5, 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,2012 & Sections 3-1 (W-1), 3-2 (5) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,1989.
Heard.
As per the prosecution story, appellant and his co-accused had raped the prosecutrix, who is a minor. Prosecutrix while appearing in the witness box has duly supported the prosecution case.
Keeping in view the seriousness of allegations levelled against the appellant, no ground for grant of bail to him is made out.
Dismissed."
5. It is also pertinent to mention here that the appeal filed by the accused seeking bail under section 439 Cr.P.C. was dismissed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court after considering statement of the prosecutrix recorded during trial, however the appeals seeking bail having been dismissed thrice by the Coordinate Bench of this Court the accused again filed bail application under Section (4 of 7) [CRLAS-1135/2019] 439 Cr.P.C. before the learned trial court which was allowed by the learned trial court vide order dated 4-5-2019. Hence, being aggrieved the present appeal seeking cancellation of bail has been filed by the complainant challenging the order dated 4-5-2019 passed by the learned trial court.

6. Counsel for the complainant submitted that the order passed by the learned trial court amounts to judicial indiscipline and once the appeal preferred by the accused seeking bail has been dismissed by the High Court after considering statement of the prosecturix the learned trial court while exercising its power under section 439 Cr.P.C. erred in granting bail to the accused as there was no change in the circumstances after rejection of his appeal by this Court seeking bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. Counsel further submits that the victim (minor girl) aged about 16 years has been raped by two persons and the victim in her statement recorded during trial has specifically levelled the allegation of committing rape on her against the accused.

7. Counsel further submits that the learned trial court erred in granting bail to the accused on the ground that he is in custody since 18-4-2017.

8. Counsel further submits that certainly the High Court can cancel the bail granted by the Sessions Court, looking to the seriousness of the offence alleged against the accused and in the present matter the accused along with co-accused raped a minor girl who is a special child having mild mental retardation.

9. In support of the contentions, counsel relied upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Anil Kumar Yadav Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) & Anr., & (5 of 7) [CRLAS-1135/2019] connected matters, reported in (2018) 12 SCC 129 and particularly referred para-24 & 32, which read as under :-

"24. As pointed out earlier, one of the grounds for grant of bail to the appellant Anil Kumar Yadav by the Sessions Court was that he was in custody for more than one year. In crimes like murder, the mere fact that the accused was in custody for more than one year, may not be a relevant consideration. In Gobarbhai Naranbhai case, it was observed that the period of incarceration by itself would not entitle the accused to be enlarged on bail. The same was reiterated in Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh.
32. It was repeatedly urged that the High Court misdirected itself in interfering with the discretionary order of the Sessions Court granting bail to the accused and there was absolutely nothing to show that the appellants are likely to abuse the bail or tamper with evidence. The court while granting bail should exercise its discretion in a judicious manner. Of course, once discretion is exercised by the Sessions Court to grant bail on consideration of relevant materials, the High Court would not normally interfere with such discretion, unless the same suffers from serious infirmities or perversity. While considering the correctness of the order granting bail, the approach should be whether the order granting bail to the accused is vitiated by any serious infirmity, in which case, the High Court can certainly interfere with the exercise of discretion. The materials available on record prima facie indicating the involvement of the accused, possibility of accused tampering with witness and the gravity of the crime were not kept in view by the Sessions Court. Since the Sessions Court granted bail to the appellants on irrelevant considerations and the same suffered from serious infirmity, the High Court rightly set aside the order of grant of bail to the accused. The impugned orders do not suffer from any infirmity warranting interference."
10. Counsel further relied upon the judgment passed by a Coordinate Bench of this Court before the Principal Seat at Jodhpur in the matter of Ashok Sachdeva Vs. State & Anr., reported in 2012(3) WLC (Raj.) 85.


(6 of 7) [CRLAS-1135/2019]

11. Counsel submits that in the light of the judgments (supra), the order passed by the learned trial court dated 4-5-2019 granting bail to the accused under Section 439 Cr.P.C. deserves to be set aside.

12. Counsel for the accused on the other hand submits that the accused has not threatened the complainant and the learned trial court has rightly passed the order dated 4-5-2019 as the trial got delayed.

13. Counsel further submits that the power of trial court granting bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. is similar to that of High Court and the trial court has not committed any illegality in granting bail to the accused.

14. Counsel further submits that the parameters of cancellation of bail under section 439(2) Cr.P.C. are different than that of granting bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C.

15. In support of the contentions, counsel for the accused relied upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Rameshwar Sharma Vs. Director of Revenue Intelligence, reported in (2018)11 SCC 713 and Sharad T. Kabra Vs. Union of India, reported in (2018) 14 SCC 493.

16. Heard counsel for the parties and perused the record.

17. In my considered view, in the present matter no change in the circumstances took place after the appeal seeking bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. was dismissed by Coordinate Bench of this Court. I am of the considered view that the learned trial court has committed gross illegality in granting bail to the accused, more particularly when the appeal seeking bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. was dismissed by the Coordinate Bench of this Court after considering statement of the victim recorded during trial and (7 of 7) [CRLAS-1135/2019] looking to the seriousness of the offence, the reason assigned by the learned trial court that the accused is in custody since 18-4- 2017, in my considered view may not be a relevant consideration for exercising discretion in favour of the accused under section 439 Cr.P.C., as has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Anil Kumar Yadav (supra).

18. Thus, in the facts and circumstances of this case the Registry is directed to place a copy of this order before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for information.

19. In that view of the matter, the present application for cancellation of bail is allowed. The order passed by the learned trial court dated 4-5-2019 is set aside. The bail bonds of the accused are directed to be cancelled and the learned Trial Judge is directed to take the accused into custody and proceed with the trial of the case.
